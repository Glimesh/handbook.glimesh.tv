However Glimesh is not a non-profit, or public company, instead it is a privately owned C Corporation registered in the state of Delaware. Glimesh, Inc. is currently wholly owned by Luke Strickland.
Ownership Stakes Luke Strickland - 100%
Future Ownership Plan There&amp;rsquo;s much about the ownership of Glimesh that we hope to change over time. Ideally we can build a hybrid company that embraces all of the required-transparency benefits of a non-profit, the original &amp;ldquo;price to cost&amp;rdquo; ideals of Gittip, and the compensation of correctly managed for-profit companies.</description></item><item><title>Open Company</title><link>https://handbook.glimesh.tv/company/open-company/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.glimesh.tv/company/open-company/</guid><description>Glimesh, Inc. is a new type of company, an open company.

In the future (after Glimesh/glimesh.tv#618 is resolved), we should be able to run the process automatically.
Running Payday Manually The easiest way to run Payday is just to IEx into a web node, and run Glimesh.PaymentProviders.StripeProvider.payout(). However we don&amp;rsquo;t run that ever, because we want to manually review the transfers that are scheduled for the week.</description></item><item><title>Regions</title><link>https://handbook.glimesh.tv/engineering/regions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:39:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://handbook.glimesh.tv/engineering/regions/</guid><description>Because of Glimesh&amp;rsquo;s focus on low latency, high quality streams, using regions close to you will give you the best experience.
